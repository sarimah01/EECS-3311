1) What is your conclusion, does the first or
second player have some advantage, at least for a random strategy?
The results indicate that the second player (P2) has a significant advantage over the first player (P1)
when both are using a random strategy. The probability of P2 winning was higher than that of P1.

3) Briefly write your thoughts on the above video below:

The speaker Jake Vanderplas talks about bridging coding and statistical analysis. He talks about the
importance of statistical analysis and various methods that can be used for statistical analysis.
The practical examples he used, like the coin toss and shuffling techniques,
showed how programming can make complex stats concepts easier to grasp.
His emphasis on the fact that asking the right questions is crucial in statistics.
It made me realize that before jumping into data analysis its important to clarify goals to avoid getting lost in the details.

4) H0 is There is no significant difference in the winning probabilities between
the first player (P1) and the second player (P2) when both players use random strategies in Othello.

5) Ha is The second player (P2) has a significantly higher probability of winning
than the first player (P1) when both players use random strategies in Othello.

6) Choose one of the following and delete the other:
   My experimental results do not support H0, so they support Ha

7) As in the video, use either math or code (add a Java Class) to argue for or against H0
Let's assume we ran 10,000 games and observed the following results:

- Probability P1 wins: P(P1) = p1wins / numGames = 2444 / 10000 = 0.2444
- Probability P2 wins: P(P2) = p2wins / numGames = 3773 / 10000 = 0.3773

This means:
- P1 wins approximately 24.44% of the time.
- P2 wins approximately 37.73% of the time.

To analyze whether this difference is statistically significant,
we can perform a hypothesis test (like a chi-squared test or a two-proportion z-test).
For simplicity, let’s consider a two-proportion z-test:

1. Calculate the test statistic (z):
z = (p1 - p2) / sqrt(p(1-p) * (1/n1 + 1/n2))
where:
- p1 = 0.2444
- p2 = 0.3773
- n1 = n2 = 10000
- p = (p1 + p2) / 2 = (0.2444 + 0.3773) / 2 = 0.31085

2. Substitute the values:
z = (0.2444 - 0.3773) / sqrt(0.31085 * (1-0.31085) * (1/10000 + 1/10000))
Calculate the denominator:
sqrt(0.31085 * 0.68915 * 0.0002) ≈ sqrt(0.0000427) ≈ 0.00655

Now, plug it into the formula for z:
z ≈ (-0.1329) / 0.00655 ≈ -20.24

3. Determine the p-value:
Given that our z-score is significantly negative, we can consult a z-table or use software to find the p-value.
A z-score of -20.24 is extremely unlikely to occur under the null hypothesis.

4. Conclusion:
Since the p-value is much lower than any conventional alpha level (e.g., 0.05), we reject H0.
This suggests that the second player (P2) indeed has a significant advantage over
the first player (P1) when both are using random strategies in Othello.
