1) What is your conclusion, does the first or
second player have some advantage, at least for a random strategy?


2) Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq9DzN6mvYA

3) Briefly write your thoughts on the above video below:

4) H0 is There is no significant difference in the winning probabilities between
the first player (P1) and the second player (P2) when both players use random strategies in Othello.

5) Ha is The second player (P2) has a significantly higher probability of winning
than the first player (P1) when both players use random strategies in Othello.

6) Choose one of the following and delete the other:
   My experimental results do not support H0, so they support Ha

7) As in the video, use either math or code (add a Java Class) to argue for or against H0
